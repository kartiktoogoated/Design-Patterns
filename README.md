# ðŸš€ JavaScript Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of **popular design patterns** in JavaScript.  
Design patterns help in writing **scalable, maintainable, and efficient code**.

## ðŸ“Œ Design Patterns in JavaScript

Design patterns are divided into three main categories: **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral**.  
Each pattern follows **best practices** to enhance reusability, maintainability, and flexibility in software development.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Creational Patterns**
Creational patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, ensuring that objects are created in a controlled and efficient manner.

### ðŸ”¹ **Singleton**
Ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global access point**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Factory**
Encapsulates object creation logic and allows creating objects **without specifying their exact class**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Builder**
Provides a step-by-step approach to **construct complex objects** with flexibility and readability.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Structural Patterns**
Structural patterns focus on **how objects and classes are composed**, ensuring efficient relationships between components.

### ðŸ”¹ **Decorator**
Allows dynamically **adding new behaviors** to objects **without modifying their existing code**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Module**
Encapsulates related functions and variables in a **self-contained unit**, preventing global scope pollution.

### ðŸ”¹ **Proxy**
Acts as a **wrapper or placeholder** to control access to an object, commonly used for **caching, security, and API requests**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Behavioral Patterns**
Behavioral patterns focus on **communication between objects** and the delegation of responsibilities.

### ðŸ”¹ **Strategy**
Encapsulates a family of algorithms, allowing them to be **interchanged dynamically at runtime**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Command**
Encapsulates **requests as objects**, allowing actions to be **queued, logged, and undone**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Observer**
Defines a **one-to-many dependency**, where multiple objects get notified **automatically when the subject changes**.
